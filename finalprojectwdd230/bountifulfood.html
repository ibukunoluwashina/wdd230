                    Rich in both vitamins A and C, strawberry seeds also contain minerals that support immune function. this combination

            <div class="text">We also have a fruit mixture called Antioxidant plate, this a mixture of Fig, red grape, pomegranate
                The resveratrol in red grapes — and red wine — offers powerful antioxidant and anti-aging properties that help combat 
                disease and signs of aging. Grapes are also high in lutein and zeaxanthin, which keeps our vision strong and can minimize 
                the harmful effects of ultraviolet rays. Pomegranates contain higher levels of antioxidants than most fruits and can help 
                to reverse free-radical skin damage. Figs are not only dangerously delicious — they are also rich in minerals including 
                potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, and copper and they are a great source of vitamins A, E, and K. Incorporate some of 
                these antioxidant fruits on your plate to help you fight disease, age gracefully, and keep strong.

                <div class="text">the mixture of fruit call the Detoxifying plate contains Goji berry, watermelon, lemon We can’t detoxify without 
                    the help of foods that will hydrate and flush toxins out of the system. So, let’s start with watermelon, which is 92 percent 
                    water and also contains a major detoxifying agent called glutathione. It is also a source of lycopene and vitamins A and C, 
                    which further aid in detoxing and fighting free radicals. Super alkaline upon digestion, lemon is also a strong detoxifier and 
                    has antibacterial and antiviral qualities. I like to squeeze it over my fruit, add it to green juice (with lots of parsley and 
                    cucumber for a major de-bloating combination), or drink it with warm water first thing in the morning to help cleanse the body 
                    and get the digestive system going. And let’s not forget goji berries. These little guys are a great source of antioxidants, vitamins 
                    (A, B, C, and E), iron, and choline, which the liver needs for detoxification processes.

            <div class="text">The Beauty plate mixture contains Blackberry, papaya, cantaloupe Here’s what you should be eating on the morning before your 
                next big event!Papaya is full of antioxidants and nutrients that assist in the production of collagen. It also contains an enzyme called 
                papain that helps to counter skin damage. Blackberries are delicious low-sugar fruits that are packed with antioxidants and vitamins A and C.
                We don’t want to miss out on cantaloupe. It contains beta-carotene, which is converted into vitamin A in the body and helps make our skin 
                glow and our hair strong and shiny.

                    charge up your pre- or post-workout, throw together this energy plate. These nutrient-rich fruits (yes, avocado is a fruit) will replenish and 
                    keep you going for hours. Bananas provide us with quick energy and are a great choice pre-workout. The healthy fats in avocados slow down digestion 
                    and are better to incorporate into your post-workout meal. Apples are high in fiber and will keep you full for long periods of time. Take your pick 
                    or choose all three… If you're looking for a burst of energy, this plate is for you.</div>
