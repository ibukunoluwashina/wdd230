                    <p>The rule of thirds is applied by aligning a subject with the guide lines and their intersection
                        points, placing the horizon on the top or bottom line, or allowing linear features in the image
                        to flow from section to section. The main reason for observing the rule of thirds is to
                        discourage
                        placement of the subject at the center, or prevent a horizon from appearing to divide the
                        picture
                        in half. Michael Ryan and Melissa Lenos, authors of the book An Introduction to Film Analysis:
                        Technique and Meaning in Narrative Film, state that the use of rule of thirds is "favored by
                        cinematographers in their effort to design balanced and unified images"
                        When filming or photographing people, it is common to line the body up to a vertical line and
                        the
                        person's eyes to a horizontal line. If filming a moving subject, the same pattern is often
                        followed, with the majority of the extra room being in front of the person
                        (the way they are moving).[6] Likewise, when photographing a still subject who is not directly
                        facing the camera, the majority of the extra room should be in front of the subject with the
                        vertical line running through their perceived center of mass.</p>

                    <p>Every element on the page should have a visual connection with another element, 
                        whether that’s an obvious connection (such as in a table) or a subtle one (invisible lines). 
                        Elements should not be randomly placed. Visual disconnection is the biggest cause of unpleasant 
                        looking documents. Use a grid when it’s applicable to do so, and always use strong alignments. 
                        I talked about alignments in my last post, A Designer’s Notes: Typography, so you can check 
                        that out for more. Spoiler: use left align. 
                        There is one more alignment we need to talk about: justify. 
                        Justify changes the space between words to align the text to both edges of a text box. 
                        If you have too little text, you can create rivers where there are large gaps between 
                        words across multiple lines. However, justify is also an academic formatting standard, 
                        and is used in print. It is not advisable to use in web though, because you have no 
                        control over how text will look across multiple font and screen sizes.

                    <p>Hick's law, or the Hick–Hyman law, named after British and American psychologists William 
                       Edmund Hick and Ray Hyman, describes the time it takes for a person to make a decision as a 
                       result of the possible choices: increasing the number of choices will increase the decision 
                       time logarithmically. The Hick–Hyman law assesses cognitive information capacity in choice 
                       reaction experiments. The amount of time taken to process a certain amount of bits in the 
                       Hick–Hyman law is known as the "rate of gain of information". The plain language implication 
                       of the finding is that increasing the number of choices does not directly increase the time 
                       to choose. In other words, twice as many choices does not result in twice as long to choose. 
                       Also, because the relationship is logarithmic, the increase in time it takes to choose becomes 
                       less and less as the number of choices increases.
