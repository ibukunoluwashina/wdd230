    <main>
        <div class="overview">
        <h2>Map, reduce, and filter</h2>
        <p> These are all array methods in JavaScript. Each one will iterate over an array 
            and perform a transformation or computation. Each will return a new array based
            on the result of the function.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="map">
            <h2>Map</h2>
            <p>The map() method is used for creating a new array from an existing one, applying 
                a function to each one of the elements of the first array. In the callback, only 
                the array element is required. Usually some action is performed on the value and 
                then a new value is returned.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="filter">
            <h2>Filter</h2>
            <p>The filter() method takes each element in an array and it applies a conditional statement 
               against it. If this conditional returns true, the element gets pushed to the output array. 
               If the condition returns false, the element does not get pushed to the output array.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Reduce</h2>
            <p>The reduce() method reduces an array of values down to just one value. To get the output 
               value, it runs a reducer function on each element of the array.
              
               The callback argument is a function that will be called once for every item in the array. 
               This function takes four arguments, but often only the first two are used.

               accumulator - the returned value of the previous iteration
               currentValue - the current item in the array
               index - the index of the current item
               array - the original array on which reduce was called
               The initialValue argument is optional. If provided, it will be used as the initial accumulator value in the first call to the callback function.
