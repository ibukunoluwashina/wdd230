                In 1976, the town became the capital of Ondo State. 
                s about 7°25’ north of the equator and 5°19’ east of the Ekitu. It is about 700 km (430 mi) southwest of Abuja and 311 km 
                (193 mi) north of Lagos State. Residential districts are of varying density, some area such as Arakale, Ayedun Quarters, 
                Ijoka, and Oja-Oba consist of over 200 inhabitants per hectare (81/acre), while areas such as Ijapo Estate, Alagbaka Estate, 
                Avenue and Idofin have between 60 and 100 inhabitants per hectare (24 and 40/acre). The town is situated in the tropical 
                rainforest zone in Nigeria.</p>

                <div class="text">There are two other communities with their separate kings, cultures and traditions beside the Akure kingdom. 
                     The more prominent of the pair is Isinkan, while the second of them is Isolo. The ruler of Isinkan is known as the Iralepo 
                     while that of Isolo is known as the Osolo of Isolo. In the olden days, the three communities (Akure, Isinkan and Isolo) 
                     were located some distances apart. The war with the Benin empire in the pre-colonial period necessitated that the three 
                     communities move closer together however, and they have occupied their current positions ever since. Other nearby towns 
                     include Isarun, Ilara, Igbaraoke, Iju, Itaogbolu, Idanre, Owo, Ikere and Ondo.</div>

                Flowing abreast the warm spring is another cold spring which meets the warm spring at a confluence, 
                each maintaining its thermal properties. These attributes make the spring a tourist attraction in Nigeria. 
                Research suggested that the warm spring has a temperature of about 70°C at the source and 37°C at the confluence.</div>
